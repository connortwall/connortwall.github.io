Multithreaded Network Calculator

I created calculator that could work through a network connection, using a thread for each client connection. I made a struct type to represent the data associated with a particular client, which includes the client socket file descriptor and a pointer to the shared struct Calc instance. I added synchronization to my implementation so that expression evaluations are atomic.
